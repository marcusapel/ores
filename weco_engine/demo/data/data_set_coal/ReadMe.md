# Coal Basin Dataset
## Synthetic coal exploration borehole panel for seam correlation

### Geological Setting
Intracratonic coal basin (Carboniferous/Permian or Cenozoic).
Modelled on the Ruhr Basin (Germany) / Upper Silesian Basin / Bowen Basin.
Cyclic coal-bearing sequences (cyclothems) with 6 named seams.

### Geological Features
- **Seam splitting**: Thick seams split into upper/lower splits with dirt parting
- **Washout zones**: Fluvial channels locally erode and replace seams
- **Tonstein (volcanic ash)**: Isochronous marker within coal — best correlation tool
- **Marine bands (Goniatitenschicht)**: Basin-wide shale markers above major seams
- **Brandschiefer (burnt shale)**: Thermally altered roof from ancient seam fires
- **Ironstone nodules (Toneisenstein)**: Siderite concretions in roof shale
- **Rider seams**: Thin coal stringers above/below main seam
- **Rootlet beds (Wurzelboden)**: Seat earths with in-situ root traces

### Well Logs
| Log  | Description              | Unit    | Key Coal Response    |

| RT   | Resistivity              | Ω·m     | Very high (500+)     |
| DEN  | Bulk density             | g/cc    | Very low (1.3)       |
| CAL  | Caliper                  | inches  | Washout (9–12)       |
| SON  | Sonic slowness           | µs/ft   | Very high (120)      |
| NEU  | Neutron porosity         | %       | Very high (55)       |

### Recommended WeCo Parameters
See `options_coal.txt` — optimised for multi-log seam correlation.

### Correlation Strategy
1. **Primary indicator**: DEN (bulk density) — coal at 1.3 g/cc is uniquely low
2. **Secondary**: GR — coal has very low radioactivity
3. **Supporting**: SON, RT — coal shows extreme values in both
4. **QC**: CAL — coal washout confirms seam identification
5. **Constraint**: SEAM region with `same-region` — if seam IDs are available

### Generation
- Wells: 30 (6×5 grid with jitter)
- Seed: 2026
- Sample spacing: 0.2 m (fine resolution for thin seams)
