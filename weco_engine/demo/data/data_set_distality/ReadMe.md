# Data Set 3 — Hugin Formation, Gudrun–Sigrun Field Area (7 wells)

## Source

**Hugin Formation** (Upper Jurassic, Oxfordian–Kimmeridgian), Gudrun–Sigrun
field area, blocks 15/3 and 15/5, South Viking Graben, Norwegian North Sea.
Well data provided by **Equinor ASA**.

## Wells: 7

Seven exploration/appraisal wells with interpreted sedimentary facies,
relative well distality, and biostratigraphic data.

## Data Channels

- **Depth**: Measured depth (m)
- **Facies** (region): Interpreted depositional facies (tide-influenced
  shallow marine, codes 1–8)
- **Distality** (region): Relative proximal-distal position
  (1=distal/offshore → N=proximal/onshore)

## Geological Context

The Hugin Formation is a **tide-dominated shallow marine** to coastal-plain
succession deposited during the late rifting phase of the Viking Graben.
The depositional system shows a proximal-to-distal gradient from tidal
channels and bars (high-energy, sandy) to prodelta and offshore muds
(low-energy, shaly).

Key geological features:
- **Lateral facies change**: Dramatic change from proximal tidal channels
  to distal offshore over ~10 km
- **Repeated parasequences**: Multiple transgressive–regressive cycles
  create correlation ambiguity
- **Biostratigraphic control**: Palynological biozones constrain
  chronostratigraphy (hard boundaries)

## Correlation Strategy

### Distality cost (option files 1x)
Uses `dist-distal` + `dist-facies` → enforces Walther's Law.
Facies ordering reflects palaeogeographic position.

### Multi-distality (option files 2x)
Tests multiple sediment transport directions (`multi_distal.txt`)
to determine best-fit palaeogeography.

## Validation

Correlation results are validated against **biostratigraphic interpretations**:

> well correlation simulations to biostratigraphic interpretations."
