# Data Set 2 — Dionisos Process-Based Geomodel (Coastal Deltaic)

## Purpose

Synthetic dataset generated from the **Dionisos** forward stratigraphic
modelling software. Represents a coastal deltaic system where the
stratigraphy is *known* because it was forward-modelled — providing
ground truth for validation.

## Wells: 9

Nine wells extracted from a Dionisos 3D stratigraphic simulation of
a prograding coastal deltaic system.

## Data Channels

- **X, Y, Depth**: 3D coordinates
- **Facies** (region): Depositional facies from forward model
- **Azimuth**: Structural azimuth from model geometry
- **Dip**: Structural dip from model geometry

## External Files

- **dep_profile.txt**: Depositional profile from Dionisos output
- **dep_facies.txt**: Facies spatial distribution from forward model

## Geological Context

Dionisos (developed at IFP Energies nouvelles) simulates sediment
transport, deposition, and compaction over geological time scales.
The resulting 3D model is *physically consistent* — mass is conserved,
Walther's Law is satisfied by construction, and the geometry
reflects the modelled basin accommodation and sediment supply.

## Correlation Strategy

Uses the **B3D** (3D Bézier) cost function with structural dip/azimuth
data from the forward model. The known model stratigraphy serves as
ground truth for assessing correlation accuracy.

## Significance

Process-based models provide the **only true ground truth** for
correlation algorithms because the time-surfaces are known exactly.
Real outcrop/well data always has residual uncertainty in the
reference correlation itself.
