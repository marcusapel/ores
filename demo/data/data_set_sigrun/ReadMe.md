# Sigrun Field Dataset

## Overview

Hugin Formation (Upper Jurassic), Sigrun field, block 15/3, Norwegian North Sea.
A tide-influenced shallow marine system with lateral facies changes from tidal
channels/bars (proximal) to prodelta/offshore (distal). Wells spaced 3–8 km.

Rebuilt from original RMS well exports, Equinor biostrat/facies databases,
and published flooding surface picks. See `rebuild_from_source.py` for the
complete data pipeline.

## Data Channels (7)

| Channel | Description | Source |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| GR | Gamma ray (API) | LFP_GR from RMS well export |

## Facies Classification

### FACIES (5-class, consolidation B)

| Code | Association | Typical GR | Wells with core |
|------|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Channel / Bar | Low (< 50) | 15_3-4, 15_3-5 |
| 2 | Shoreface / Tidal Flat | Low–Med | 15_3-4, 15_3-5 |
| 3 | Lagoon / Bay | Med–High | 15_3-4, 15_3-5 |
| 4 | Prodelta / Offshore | High (> 80) | 15_3-4, 15_3-5 |
| 5 | Continental | Variable | 15_3-4, 15_3-5 |

### FACIES3 (3-class, consolidation C)

| Code | Class | GR threshold | Purpose |
|------|-------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | Sand | GR < 55 | Most conservative grouping |
| 2 | Mixed | 55 ≤ GR ≤ 85 | Transitional |
| 3 | Shale | GR > 85 | Fine-grained |

Wells without core (15_3-9_T2, 15_3-7, 15_3-3, 15_3-1_S) have facies
derived from GR cutoffs, consistent with the core-calibrated wells.

## Biostratigraphy

| Code | Age | Biozone (NPD) |
|------|-----|---------------|
| 1 | Oxfordian | Zone 35 |
| 2 | Early Kimmeridgian | Zone 36 |
| 3 | Late Kimmeridgian | Zone 37 |
| 4 | Early Volgian | Zone 38 |
| 5 | Late Volgian | Zone 39 |

## Flooding Surfaces (Sequence Boundaries)

Common markers present in ALL 6 wells, used for no-crossing constraint:

| Surface | Sequence below → above | Geological significance |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Hugin_FS_i | Zone 1 → 2 | Mid-Kimmeridgian flooding |
| Hugin_FS_h | Zone 2 → 3 | Late Kimmeridgian flooding |
| Hugin_FS_g | Zone 3 → 4 | Volgian flooding |

Additional picks exist (FS_j, FS_f, FS_fm, TopSleipner) but are NOT
used as constraints because they are not reliably identified in all wells.

## Correlation Scenarios (6)

All scenarios run in ~5 seconds (1.5 m sampling, 46–165 samples/well).

| # | File | Method | Nodes | Cors | Purpose |
|---|------|--------|-------|------|---------|
| 1 | `options_1_gr_baseline.txt` | GR only | 256 | 1200 | Unconstrained reference |
| 2 | `options_2_gr_sequence.txt` | GR + no-crossing=SEQUENCE | 269 | 864 | Constrained by flooding surfaces |
| 3 | `options_3_gr_facies5.txt` | GR + dist-facies (5-class) | 256 | 198 | Facies-distality, most constrained |
| 4 | `options_4_gr_facies3.txt` | GR + dist-facies (3-class) | 256 | 1600 | Conservative facies |
| 5 | `options_5_composite_sequence.txt` | GR+NPHI + no-crossing | 252 | 1920 | Multi-signal |
| 6 | `options_6_full.txt` | GR + sequence + facies3 | 268 | 1400 | Combined constraints |

### Design philosophy

- Scenario 1 = **full uncertainty** (what does GR alone say?)
- Scenarios 2–5 = each adds ONE constraint type to test if it helps
- Scenario 6 = combination of best constraints
- Compare: if more constrained → LESS plausible → that constraint = noise

### Key findings

- Scenario 3 (5-class facies) gives fewest correlations (198) = most constrained
- Scenario 4 (3-class facies) is looser (1600) = conservative consolidation works better
- No-crossing + dist-facies combined (in initial tests) over-constrains → designed
  Scenario 6 to use sequence + facies3 (softer combination) instead

## Validation Against Published Correlation

The reference correlation panel (`tmp/sigrun/Correlation_panel_1_500_sigrun_wells.pdf`)
shows Equinor's internal interpretation of Hugin flooding surfaces. This represents
ONE of many possible solutions.

**Validation approach**: The published correlation should appear as one of the
n-best solutions in Scenarios 2 or 6 (which use the same flooding surfaces as
constraints). The remaining solutions represent genuine geological uncertainty.

**ZONELOG_REF** (existing zone log) is included as a data channel for
post-hoc validation — it is NEVER used as an input constraint.
